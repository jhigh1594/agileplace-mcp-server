# FastMCP Cloud - Final Fix Guide

## 🎯 **SOLUTION: Standalone Server Approach**

The issue was that FastMCP Cloud couldn't import the `agileplace_mcp` module. I've created a **standalone server.py** file that contains everything needed.

## ✅ **What's Fixed**

### New File Structure
```
agileplace-mcp-server/
├── server.py                    # ← NEW: Standalone server with all tools
├── agileplace_mcp/              # ← Supporting modules
│   ├── auth.py
│   ├── client.py
│   ├── models.py
│   └── tools/
└── requirements.txt
```

### New FastMCP Cloud Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Repository** | `jhigh1594/agileplace-mcp-server` |
| **Entrypoint** | `server.py:mcp` |
| **Environment Variables** | `AGILEPLACE_DOMAIN`, `AGILEPLACE_API_TOKEN` |

## 🚀 **Deploy Now - 3 Simple Steps**

### Step 1: Update Your FastMCP Cloud Project

1. **Go to your project** on https://fastmcp.cloud
2. **Open Project Settings**
3. **Update Entrypoint** to: `server.py:mcp`
4. **Save Configuration**

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your FastMCP Cloud project:
- `AGILEPLACE_DOMAIN` = `yourcompany.leankit.com`
- `AGILEPLACE_API_TOKEN` = `your_token_here`

### Step 3: Test the Deployment

After the update:
- ✅ No more "No module named agileplace_mcp" errors
- ✅ No more "File not found" errors
- ✅ Server starts successfully
- ✅ All 40+ tools are available

## 🔧 **How This Works**

### Standalone Server Approach
The new `server.py` file:
- ✅ Contains all FastMCP tools in one file
- ✅ Imports from the `agileplace_mcp/` package
- ✅ No complex module resolution needed
- ✅ FastMCP Cloud can run it directly

### Why This Fixes Everything
1. **No Module Import Issues** - FastMCP Cloud runs `server.py` directly
2. **No Package Installation** - Everything is self-contained
3. **Simple Entrypoint** - Just `server.py:mcp`
4. **All Tools Available** - 40+ tools in one file

## 📊 **What's Included in server.py**

### Complete Tool Set (40+ tools)

- **Card Operations** (15 tools) 
- **Connection Tools** (11 tools)

## 🎉 **Expected Result**

After updating your FastMCP Cloud project:

```
✅ Deployment successful

```

## 🔗 **Connect Claude Desktop**

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

    }
  }
}
```

## 🧪 **Test Your Server**

Try these commands in Claude Desktop:
