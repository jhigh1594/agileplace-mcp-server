## Option 2: Local Installation

### Step 1: Get Your AgilePlace API Token

1. Log in to your AgilePlace account
2. Navigate to: `https://your-subdomain.leankit.com/account/api`
3. Click "Create Token"
4. Give it a description (e.g., "MCP Server")

### Step 2: Install the MCP Server

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jhigh1594/agileplace-mcp-server.git
cd agileplace-mcp-server

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

### Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop

1. Open your Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the AgilePlace MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agileplace": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "agileplace_mcp.server"],
      "env": {
        "AGILEPLACE_DOMAIN": "your-subdomain.leankit.com",
        "AGILEPLACE_API_TOKEN": "paste_your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Replace `your-subdomain` with your actual AgilePlace domain
4. Replace `paste_your_token_here` with your API token from Step 1
5. Save the file

### Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop

Close and reopen Claude Desktop to load the new MCP server.

## Step 5: Verify It's Working

In Claude Desktop, try asking:

> "List all my AgilePlace boards"

If successful, Claude will show you a list of your boards!

## Example Queries to Try

### View Boards
- "Show me all boards in AgilePlace"
- "Get details about board [board_id]"
- "What are the lanes on board [board_id]?"

### Work with Cards
- "List cards on the 'Q1 Projects' board"
- "Create a new card titled 'Fix login bug' in the Backlog lane on board [board_id]"
- "Show me details of card [card_id]"
- "Move card [card_id] to the 'In Progress' lane"
- "Update card [card_id] to high priority"

### Manage Connections
- "Show me the children of card [card_id]"
- "Create a parent-child connection between card [parent_id] and card [child_id]"
- "What are the parents of card [card_id]?"

### Dependencies
- "Create a dependency where card [card_id] depends on card [other_card_id] finishing"
- "Show me all dependencies for card [card_id]"

### Users and Teams
- "Find users with 'john' in their name"
- "List all teams"
- "Who is assigned to board [board_id]?"

### Bulk Operations
- "Update cards [id1], [id2], [id3] to high priority"
- "Move cards [id1] and [id2] to lane [lane_id]"

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Check your `AGILEPLACE_DOMAIN` is correct (without https://)
- Verify your API token is valid
- Make sure environment variables are in the correct format

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- The server will automatically retry
- If persistent, reduce request frequency

### "Can't connect to server"
- Restart Claude Desktop
- Check that Python is in your PATH
- Verify the package is installed: `pip list | grep agileplace-mcp`
