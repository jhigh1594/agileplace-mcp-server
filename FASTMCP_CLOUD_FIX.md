# FastMCP Cloud Deployment Fix

## 🚨 Current Issue

FastMCP Cloud is looking for the old file path:
```
❌ /app/src/server.py (File not found)
```

But the file is now located at:
```
✅ /app/agileplace_mcp/server.py
```

## 🔧 Fix Steps

### Step 1: Update Your FastMCP Cloud Project Settings

1. **Go to your FastMCP Cloud project**
   - Visit: https://fastmcp.cloud
   - Sign in and go to your AgilePlace project

2. **Update the Entrypoint**
   - Go to **Project Settings** or **Configuration**
   - Find the **Entrypoint** field
   - Change from: `src/server.py:mcp`
   - Change to: `agileplace_mcp/server.py:mcp`

3. **Save the Configuration**
   - Click **Save** or **Update**
   - FastMCP Cloud will automatically redeploy

### Step 2: Verify the Fix

After updating the entrypoint:

1. **Check Deployment Logs**
   - Look for successful deployment messages
   - Should see: "Server started successfully"

2. **Test the Server**
   - Your server URL should work: `https://your-project-name.fastmcp.app/mcp`
   - No more "File not found" errors

## 📋 Complete Configuration

Your FastMCP Cloud project should have:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Repository** | `jhigh1594/agileplace-mcp-server` |
| **Entrypoint** | `agileplace_mcp/server.py:mcp` |
| **Environment Variables** | `AGILEPLACE_DOMAIN`, `AGILEPLACE_API_TOKEN` |

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you still get errors:

1. **Check the entrypoint is exactly**: `agileplace_mcp/server.py:mcp`
2. **Verify environment variables are set**
3. **Check that the repository is up to date**
4. **Look at the deployment logs for specific errors**

### Common Mistakes:

❌ **Wrong entrypoint formats:**
- `src/server.py:mcp` (old path)
- `agileplace_mcp/server.py` (missing :mcp)
- `server.py:mcp` (missing directory)

✅ **Correct entrypoint:**
- `agileplace_mcp/server.py:mcp`

## 🎯 Expected Result

After the fix, you should see:

```
✅ Server deployed successfully
✅ Entrypoint: agileplace_mcp/server.py:mcp
✅ Environment variables loaded
✅ Server running at: https://your-project-name.fastmcp.app/mcp
```
